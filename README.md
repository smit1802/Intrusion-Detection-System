# Intrusion-Detection-System
This is an Network Intrusion Detection System which Identifies malicious requests.


<h3>Dataset</h3>
Here I have utilised the famous <a href=http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html>KDD Cup 1999 Dataset</a>

<h3>Attack Vector</h3>
<br>The attacks are classified into 4 main categories, namely :

<br>DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood
<br>R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password
<br>U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various buffer overflow attacks
<br>probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning
